# KYC Boundary Policy

**Status**: Implemented (SPIKE-146 / Issue #797)  
**Last Updated**: 2026-10-15

## Overview

ZK-VOTE integrates SEP-6/24/31 anchor flows (Circle/Tempo) for fiat on/off-ramps adjacent to an anonymous voting product. This creates a critical boundary between:

- **Verified-ramp subsystem**: Identity-checked fiat flows (KYC required by anchors)
- **Anonymous-voting subsystem**: Privacy-preserving ballot casting (zero-knowledge proofs)

This document defines how KYC-adjacent data from anchors is handled to prevent:

1. Over-collection of identity data beyond operational necessity
2. Deanonymization of voters via ramp↔ballot linkage
3. Confused user mental models about anonymity boundaries

## Architecture

### Data Minimization

**Status-only ingestion** enforced at parser level (`kycBoundary.ts`):

```typescript
export interface MinimizedKYCState {
  status: KYCStatus; // completed | pending_* | error | incomplete
  reasonCode?: KYCReasonCode; // kyc_required | verification_in_progress | ...
  interactiveUrl?: string; // For user action (validated separately)
  interactiveOrigin?: string;
  timestamp: number; // For retention policy
}
```

**Rejected fields** (never stored):

- Identity documents (passports, driver's licenses, etc.)
- Detailed anchor metadata (KYC provider names, document types, etc.)
- Verbose error messages containing PII
- Any anchor-specific tracking identifiers beyond status codes

### Enforcement

`enforceMinimizationBoundary()` validates anchor responses before processing:

- Detects excess fields beyond allowed set
- Logs violations with field names (first 10 only)
- **Strict mode** (`KYC_STRICT_MODE=true`): Rejects responses with excess fields

`minimizeKYCResponse()` maps anchor statuses to coarse-grained enums:

- Maps verbose anchor statuses → 6 status categories
- Maps error messages → 5 reason codes (no PII leakage)
- Strips all other fields before persistence

### Access Control

Role-based field-level access (`KYCAccessLevel`):

| Access Level    | Can View                           |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| NONE (0)        | Nothing                            |
| STATUS_ONLY (1) | Pass/fail status only              |
| REASON_CODE (2) | Status + reason codes              |
| FULL (3)        | All minimized fields (ops/support) |

Enforcement via `filterKYCByAccess()` - queries redact fields based on caller role.

### Retention Policy

Auto-purge based on transaction status:

| Status       | Retention Horizon | Rationale                                   |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Completed    | 90 days           | Compliance minimum for dispute resolution   |
| Pending      | 30 days           | User has time to complete interactive KYC   |
| Failed/Error | 7 days            | User can retry; no long-term storage needed |

`shouldPurgeKYCState()` checks age vs. retention horizon.

**Implementation**: Background job should call purge logic daily (not yet implemented - acceptance criteria item).

## User Experience

### Boundary Honesty

Users see two distinct subsystems with clear boundaries:

1. **Anonymous voting**: "Your ballot is private. We use zero-knowledge proofs to verify eligibility without revealing your identity."
2. **Fiat ramp**: "Deposits/withdrawals require identity verification by our payment partner (Circle/Tempo) to comply with regulations. This verification is separate from your voting activity."

Frontend (`DepositWithdraw.tsx`) renders KYC iframe with security:

- Origin validation via `isTrustedAnchorMessage()`
- Sandbox attributes restrict iframe capabilities
- Clear labeling: "Circle USDC/EURC anchors via ANCHOR_USDC_URL"

### Privacy Red Lines

**Never joined**:

- Vote nullifiers ↔ ramp account addresses
- Ballot commitments ↔ KYC status
- DAO membership ↔ fiat transaction details

**Reconciliation state isolation**:

- Payment jobs table stores `tenant_id`, not voter identities
- Audit logs use coarse-grained KYC status, never full anchor payloads

## Anchor Data Processing Agreement Review

**Action Required**: Legal review of data processing terms with anchors:

- [ ] Circle USDC anchor DPA
- [ ] Circle EURC anchor DPA
- [ ] Tempo (if integrated)

Questions for legal:

1. What KYC data does anchor store vs. what we store?
2. What are anchor's retention obligations vs. ours?
3. Can we enforce status-only ingestion in anchor contract?
4. What dispute resolution data must we retain (affects retention horizons)?

## Metrics

Prometheus metrics for monitoring (`metrics.ts`):

- `zkvote_kyc_data_minimization_total`: Anchor responses minimized
- `zkvote_kyc_access_denial_total`: Field access attempts denied
- `zkvote_kyc_retention_purge_total`: Records purged by retention policy

## Testing

### Minimization Tests

- [ ] Parser rejects responses with excess fields (strict mode)
- [ ] Status mapping covers all anchor status codes
- [ ] Reason code mapping strips PII from error messages

### Access Control Tests

- [ ] STATUS_ONLY role cannot see reason codes
- [ ] REASON_CODE role cannot see interactive URLs
- [ ] Cross-role queries correctly filter fields

### Retention Tests

- [ ] Completed transactions purged after 90 days
- [ ] Pending transactions purged after 30 days
- [ ] Failed transactions purged after 7 days

### Boundary Tests

- [ ] KYC status never joined with vote nullifiers in queries
- [ ] Support views show minimized KYC data only
- [ ] Audit logs contain no identity documents

## Limitations

1. **Anchor divergence**: Each anchor (Circle, Tempo) may return different fields. Current implementation handles Circle responses; Tempo may need adjustments.
2. **Dispute flows**: If anchor requires detailed data for dispute resolution, case-by-case exceptions may be needed (with explicit expiry).
3. **Comprehension testing**: User understanding of anonymity-vs-verification boundary should be validated via UX research.

## Compliance Notes

This policy enables compliance without over-collection:

- Regulatory obligations determined by legal counsel, not code
- Product provides minimization tools; legal decides thresholds
- Anchor-DPA review will clarify data-controller vs. data-processor responsibilities
