# Smart Contract Events

This document describes all Soroban events emitted by ZK-VOTE smart contracts. Events are published on-chain and can be indexed and consumed by off-chain consumers (relayers, indexers, frontends).

## Event Structure

Each event is defined with the `#[soroban_sdk::contractevent]` macro. Fields marked with `#[topic]` are indexed and can be efficiently queried. All types use Soroban's standard serialization.

## DAO Registry Contract Events

### `DaoCreateEvent`

| `name` | String | | DAO name |

**Example Use Case**: Indexers track all DAOs created on the platform; frontends display creation events.

## Event Schema Versioning Policy (SPIKE-053 / issue #733)

Contract events are consumed by the backend indexer (`backend/src/services/indexer.ts`)
and reflected in TypeScript types (`backend/src/generated/contract-events.ts`).
Without versioned envelopes, an additive field silently shifts positional parsing
and can corrupt tallies.

### Rules (v1 — effective from this document revision)

1. **Additive-only**: new fields may be appended to existing event structs; no
   field may be removed or reordered without bumping the event schema version.
2. **Version documentation**: when a field is added to an existing event, a
   `_schema_version` note must be added to its table in this document and the
   corresponding TypeScript consumer type must be updated in the same PR.
3. **Indexer tolerance**: the backend indexer MUST use lenient positional
   parsing (ignore unknown trailing fields) so a new-version event ingests
   cleanly through an old indexer without crashing.
4. **Breaking changes** (field removal / reorder): require a dual-version
   ingestion window — emit both old and new shapes for at least one release
   cycle before removing the old shape.
5. **CI gate**: `EVENTS.md` is the source of truth. A CI check (`.github/workflows/`)
   must fail if a contract emits an event not listed in this document.

### Events added after initial release

| Event | Added in | Fields added |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| `VkProposalApprovedEvent` | SPIKE-053 | initial documentation |
| `VkProposalExecutedEvent` | SPIKE-053 | initial documentation |
| `VkProposalCancelledEvent` | SPIKE-053 | initial documentation |

## Indexing Guide

To efficiently consume these events:

1. **Use topic indices**: Filter by `dao_id` and other `#[topic]` fields for efficient queries
2. **Monitor proposal lifecycle**: Track `ProposalEvent` → votes → `ProposalClosedEvent` → `ProposalArchivedEvent`
3. **Verify membership**: Cross-reference `CommitEvent` (tree updates) with `SbtMintEvent` (membership)
4. **Nullifier validation**: Ensure votes have unique nullifiers (stored in events)

## TypeScript Consumer Types

Auto-generated TypeScript types for these events are available in `backend/src/generated/contract-events.ts`.
