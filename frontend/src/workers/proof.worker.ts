/**
 * Dedicated worker for Groth16 proof generation (#92).
 *
 * Proving used to run on the main thread. That is the worst place for it: the
 * witness holds the voter's identity secret and candidate choice, and a
 * multi-second BigInt computation on the main thread is observable from the
 * same context — it blocks rendering, so anything able to measure frame
 * pacing or event-loop latency gets a timing trace of the proof for free,
 * without needing `performance.now()` at all.
 *
 * Moving it here gives proving its own event loop and its own global scope.
 * A script on the page can no longer read the worker's memory, and the
 * main-thread stalls that leaked the trace disappear.
 *
 * The private inputs cross the boundary once, in the request message, and the
 * worker keeps nothing after it replies: `postMessage` structured-clones the
 * payload, so the copy the worker holds is dropped when the handler returns.
 *
 * Timing is masked by the caller, around the whole prover selection, so this
 * worker does not pad: two layers of padding would compound without hiding
 * anything the outer one does not already cover.
